## Project: [Online-ZOO](https://wee-owl.github.io/online-zoo/pages/main.html)  

### Description:  
Online-ZOO - [RSSchool](https://rs.school/) [task](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage1/stream2/online-zoo/README.md). It's a platform that collects information about animals from various zoos using webcams. It is assumed that the user can open the zoo's resource page, watch one of the animals, or make a donation that will go towards buying food. As part of the task, an adaptive layout and interactivity of the main page and the donation page were made.
